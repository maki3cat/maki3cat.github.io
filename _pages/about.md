Hi there, this is Maki.

I have 8 years of full-time **backend software engineer** working experience starting from a self-taught starting point (economics major of BS). During the 8 years, I was first in the applications of e-commerce platform, and then started to delve more into infra/system engineering. And I am more interested in tech-driven infra/system engineering right now; I want to be good at it so that I can build value and provide value in this direction. So I resigned from a good position in Shanghai and started my master program in computer science in the Ohio State University. Something about the campus, I enjoyed a lot in the Advanced System (actually distributed system) class; really appreciate the efforts Prof. Yang has put in this course.

Besides the working stuff, I am also an **animal welfare** supporter. There are a couple of things I have been doing; for example, I keep monthly donations for many years; I've rescued many stray cats in Shanghai by finding them good adopters. But it is still a systematic thing, and though I can make tiny contributions from a person's perspective, the impacts are still not widespread. I hope to make more positive impacts in this direction while still pursuing my career.

Finally about some spirit sharing. When I wrote this "about me" I was watching a Chinese TV-series called **"She and Her Girls"** by which I feel extremely inspired and warmed. I feel so lucky not to miss this show. Also being a girl from an unpriveledged starting point, I deeply relate to the Headmaster Zhang and the girls in many scenes; and I feel encourged by their spirits of resilience, belief, and confidence in the face of odds and despair that're much more substantial than I confront. I hope to be one of the proud Chinese girls and live up to the same kind of spirits and efforts no matter where I am.
