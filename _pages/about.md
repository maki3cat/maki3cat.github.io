Hi there, this is Maki.

I have 8 years of full-time **backend software engineer** working experience starting from a self-taught starting point (economics major of BS). During the 8 years, I was first in the development of e-commerce platforms, and then started to delve more into system engineering. To become better at this new direction, I left my job and good life in Shanghai and started my journey in the Ohio State University for a M.S. degree in computer science. And meanwhile, the huge tides of AI are changing everything in the tech-industry, so I am also spending a lot of time learning AI modeling and systems. For more information, please check my **CV for details**.

Besides the working stuff, I am also an **animal welfare** supporter. There are a couple of things I have been doing; for example, I keep monthly donations for many years; I've rescued many stray cats in Shanghai by finding them good adopters. But it is still a social problem than individual effort can change. Learning **psychology** is also part of my life, my current favorite theoretical approach is DBT (dialectical behavior therapy) and I'm also learning a lot from Alison Yu's videos, who is a licensed clinical counselor in Illinois. I really think keep learning psychology is a very healthy habit especially for people who have a lot of challenges in life.

When I wrote this "about me" I was watching a Chinese TV-series called **"She and Her Girls"** by which I feel extremely inspired and warmed. It is actually both light-hearted and moving show with a lot of laughters and tears; and the figures in this show have presented very strong optimitic and proactive attitudes in the face of difficutiles and being the unpriviledged. I feel so lucky not to miss this show. And I hope this show can gain global attention.
