Hi there, this is Maki.

I have 8 years of full-time **backend software engineer** working experience starting from a self-taught starting point (economics major of BS). During the 8 years, I was first in the applications of e-commerce platform, and then started to delve more into infra/system engineering. And I am more interested in tech-driven infra/system engineering right now; I want to be good at it so that I can build value and provide value in this direction. So I resigned from a good position in Shanghai and started my master program in computer science in the Ohio State University.

I've learned a lot of distributed system, operating system and machine learning in the first year; in the comming semester, I will focus on more on system engineering with courses of parallel computing, GPU achitecture, and database, etc. I select courses around **"infrastructure and AI"**; I have strong interest in distributed systems at scale, infrastructure reliability, scalability, security, and continuous improvement; and I hope to continue my learning, and valuer-delivery in the system engineering direction in the new era of AI.

Besides the working stuff, I am also an **animal welfare** supporter. There are a couple of things I have been doing; for example, I keep monthly donations for many years; I've rescued many stray cats in Shanghai by finding them good adopters. But it is still a systematic thing, and though I can make tiny contributions from a person's perspective, the impacts are still not widespread. I hope to make more positive impacts in this direction while still pursuing my career.

When I wrote this "about me" I was watching a Chinese TV-series called **"She and Her Girls"** by which I feel extremely inspired and warmed. It is actually both light-hearted and moving show with a lot of laughters and tears; and the figures in this show have presented very strong optimitic and proactive attitudes in the face of difficutiles and being the unpriviledged. I feel so lucky not to miss this show.
