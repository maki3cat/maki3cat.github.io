Hi there, this is Maki.

I used to be an E-person, but after years of being a software engineer I some place and some time became an I-person. And recent test shows I am an INTJ. I was ISTP same as Geralt of Rivia last year and that was cool. But I accept radically what I am right now; no self-blames.

**Computer science** is a keyword of life. It pays the bills, has empowered me to build a home and life in Shanghai, and navigates me all the way to the States just to be better at it. Obviously, it means more than a job to me, and I have interest in it. Besides the work stuff, I am also an **animal welfare** supporter. I've started monthly donations years ago; it is hard to find good projects. And I've rescued many stray cats in Shanghai by finding them adopters, and the luckest one stays with my best friend and lives a life probably better than mine. And these are the two beliefs of my life. I hope I can build more value out of my life and for this world in these two pursuits.

I am watching a famous TV series called "She and Her Girls"; and the story is about a school headmaster called Guimei Zhang who helps girls to get education and step out of the rural areas where girls have no access to educaiton and get married at 15. This story makes me feel grateful for my current life, and inspired by Guimei's incredible mental toughness, kindness, belief, resilience, and confidence. Hope girls can build a life we want as well.
